# E-commerce Project Description

E-commerce project that is similar to Amazon. The functions include searching for
an item, ordering, including shipping methods; paying for an item using a credit card. Confirmation of the purchase will be sent to the user’s email address. Possible features: different types of users, vendors can upload their products, history of orders, applicable promo codes, and “accept cookies” bar.
Searching will be conducted via a search bar and dynamic product retrieval; also, categories can be applied. Ordering from both the product page and the result page; when the product is “added to cart”, it is sent to the cart where the products can be purchased. Shipping methods would require the user to write down their address and choose one of the available options for shipment(pick up, fast delivery, regular delivery).
